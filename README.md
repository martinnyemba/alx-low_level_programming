# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING:
This repository contains projects and tasks related to low-level programming in C. The projects cover various topics such as functions, pointers, memory allocation, data structures, file I/O, and more. Below is a list of directories included in this repository:

This Project is invoves the deper and practical  understing of C Language.
C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use.

It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more
