# 0x09. C - Static libraries
## About
An introductory project on:
- static libraries, how they work, how to create one, and how to use them

# Static libraries

- are just collections of object files that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation, and are not relevant during runtime.


# Shared libraries (also called dynamic libraries)

- are linked into the program in two stages.
